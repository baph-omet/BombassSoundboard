# BombassSoundboard
**BombassSoundboard** (BAS) is a 100% free, fully-customizable soundboard. Download and add your own sounds, then play them at will to annoy your friends! No sound files are included with this program, but any `.wav` or `.mp3` sound file can be added.

## Installation
1. Save the `.exe` in a folder somewhere (preferably somewhere alone).
2. Download some sound effects (`.wav` and `.mp3` only)
3. Start the program and drag sound files into it or click the Load Sound file button.
Then you can start blasting air horns and John Cena at your leisure!
